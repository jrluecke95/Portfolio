                                <p>
                                PlatePool was a capstone project for the DigitalCrafts bootcamp. It was built in a group with 3 other software engineers. We set out to build something that allowed those who loved cooking for a crowd, but don't work in a restaurant to sell food out of their own kitchens as well as allow other users to get home cooked meals and support their neighbors by purchasing the meals they cooked. PlatePool allows users to post and purchase plates of food, comment on plates that are posted, and rate users that they have purchased food from.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                We utilized React, Redux, Material UI, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and Postgres to build this project. Material UI was used to built a responsive, fluid front-end experience. We chose this framework as it allowed us to implement some of our own styling in addition to the pre-built components that Material UI provides. React was used to construct a fully functional front-end that could fetch and display data from the API that we constructed using Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and Postgres. We utilized Redux to allow us to maintain state throughout the project as needed.
                                </p>
                                    
                                <p>
                                    This project presented many unique challenges. Managing state and a one-way data flow throughout the project while still having access to all of the information we needed in each component posed to be a larger obstacle than we initially imagined. Redux and Redux Persist were exremely helpful in this and allowed us to handle these issues with ease. My main role in this project was to construct our internal API that react would send/receieve data to and from. I also heavily assistd in the state management of the app and helped my group mates understand where their data was coming from and how they could use it within the components they were building. I also built the user profile page that allows users to look at their profile as well as edit their personal information and any plates they had posted.

                                <p>
                                This is an individually built project that allows users to register, login, create, comment, and rate recipes. Users that were logged in were allowed to create and edit their own recipes in addition to rate and comment on others' recipes. Anyone who was not logged in only had the ability to view recipes and register an account so that they could access the features mentioned above.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I utilized React, Redux, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and Postgres to build this project. Bootstrap was utilized to design a responsive front end, and React was used to build components and pages for the app in addion to fetching data from the backend to display data on the page. Express, Redux, Sequelize, and Postres were used to create a database that the front-end could access to both store and retrieve data to be displayed.
                                </p>
                                    
                                <p>
                                    This project proved to be very challenging and engaging. This app taught me the importance of utilizing React and its ability to use components to make your code less repetitive and consistantly styled. I was also able to utilize the React, Redux, Node.js in a way that allowed them to communicate with each other so that certain routes, pages, and abilities were limited to certain users of the site. This app provided with immense opportunity to grow as a developer and I thoroughly enjoyed building it.

                                <p>The group I worked with set out to build an app that allowed both coaches and athletes to create accounts, log in, and interact with each other. We developed the ability for athletes to select which coach they wanted to be assigned to, which then allowed their selected coach to assign them workouts.</p>

                                <p>We did this using Postgres, Express, Node.js, Sequelize, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. My role mainly consisted of setting the up the back end, which involved constructing our database, correctly building table relations, and ensuring that routes worked as needed, allowing the user to navigate the site with ease.</p>
                                    
                                <p>This project taught me the importance of a well thought out strategy when approaching a project. Many of our issues were resolved once we came up with the project plan, and it became much easier to build the site once we mapped out the site's functionalities.

                                    <p>This project was completed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Chart.js (a JavaScript library).

                    <p>Apart from being a software developer, I spend a lot of time in the kitchen cooking food to entertain friends. 
                        I love the process of cooking and getting to have others eat what I create in the kitchen. It allows me to use
                        my creative side in a relaxed and stress-free environment and getting to do it for others to enjoy makes it all the better.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">In order to balance out the food that I am always cooking, I try to stay physically active - whether it's working out 
                        in my home-gym or taking the dog for a walk, I'm always trying to stay moving. I also try to read as much as I can - I alternate between 
                        books on coding and web devlopment and books from some of my favorite thinkers. I really enjoy hobbies that give me some purpose and help
                        me feel like I am contributing to my own development.
